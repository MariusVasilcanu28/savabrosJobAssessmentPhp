            </p>
            <p class="aboutUsText">
              We started 9 years ago doing what we love: direct response
              advertising. In this short period, we've made tens of millions of
              dollars in sales. More important, we've established ourselves as a
              publishing powerhouse in markets like survival, self-reliance, or
              self-defense.

            </p>
            <p class="aboutUsText">
              We value people and the potential they have, more than the
              experience and the background they come with. Over the years we've
              worked with extremely talented people: financial experts, special
              forces “green berets”, gardening gurus, medical doctors. And we're
              aiming to become one of the best companies in the world in direct
              response marketing.
